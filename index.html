            My grandpa fought in World War II
            He was such a noble dude
            I can't even finish school
            Missed my mom and left too soon 
            
            His dad was a fireman 
            Who fought fires so violent 
            I think I bored my therapist 
            While playing him my violin
            
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            (Oh my God) That's so insane
            (Oh my God) That's such a shame
            Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
            But I can't help myself from feeling bad
            I kinda feel like two things can be sad
            
            [Chorus]
            The world's smallest violin
            Really needs an audience
            So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
            I'll blow up into smithereens 
            And spew my tiny symphony
            Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
            
            [Instrumental Break]
            
            [Verse 2]
            My grandpa fought in World War II
            He was such a noble dude
            Man, I feel like such a fool
            I got so much left to prove
            All my friends have vaping friends
            They're so good at making friеnds
            I'm so scared of caving in 
            Is that entertaining yеt?
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            (Oh my God) That's so insane
            (Oh my God) That's such a shame
            Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
            But I can't help myself from feeling bad
            I kinda feel like two things can be sad
            
            [Chorus]
            The world's smallest violin
            Really needs an audience
            So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
            I'll blow up into smithereens 
            And spew my tiny symphony
            Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
            
            [Instrumental Break]
            
            [Verse 3]
            Somewhere in the universe
            Somewhere someone's got it worse
            Wish that made it easier
            Wish I didn't feel the hurt
            The world's smallest violin
            Really needs an audience
            So if I do not find somebody soon
            I'll blow up into smithereens
            And spew my tiny symphony
            All up and down a city street
            While tryna put my mind at ease
            Like finishing this melody
            This feels like a necessity
            So this could be the death of me
            Or maybe just a better me
            Now come in with the timpanis
            And take a shot of Hennessy
            I know I'm not there mentally
            But you could be the remedy
            SO LET ME PLAY MY VIOLIN FOR YOU
